# @sentry/toolbar



## Development

### Setup
- Clone the repo
- Run `pnpm install`
- Run `pnpm prepare`

### Dev

To test the package locally with another project, first setup the other project:
- `yarn add @sentry/toolbar@link:../sentry-toolbar`
- `yarn dev` (or whatever command you like that does HMR)

In this repo use `pnpm build` to emit js files. You can run that inside of nodemon if you like too.
